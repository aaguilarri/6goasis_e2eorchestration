# kafkanotify-operator
A Kubernetes Operator to detect edge application location changes and produce Kafka messages with the new locaiton of the edge applicaiton to the Kafka consumers.

## Description
To ensure service continuity after an application migration event, it is essential that edge clients are aware of the updated location of the corresponding server instance. As part of our network-aware orchestration workflow, we implement a custom Kubernetes operator that handles client-side awareness of service migration.  
The migration notification mechanism consists of the following components:  
1.	Custom Resource (CR): A Kubernetes custom resource is deployed alongside the Edge Carla Application Server. This CR holds metadata such as application identity, current hosting edge node ID, and network addressing information.  
2.	Service Orchestrator: When the orchestrator triggers a service migration and updates the CR, a specific controller (Kafka Notification Controller) identifies the change in edge ID.  
3.	Kafka Notification Controller: Upon detecting a migration event, the controller acts as Kafka producer. As a producer publishes a migration event message to a predefined Kafka topic (e.g., carla-server-migration), containing the updated service endpoint information.  
4.	Client Update Mechanism: The Edge Carla Client, running on the simulated UE, subscribes to this topic as a Kafka consumer. Upon receiving the migration message, it updates its internal state to re-establish communication with the new instance of the Edge Carla Server.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kafkanotify-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kafkanotify-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kafkanotify-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kafkanotify-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
